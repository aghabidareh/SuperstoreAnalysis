# 🌟 Superstore Interactive Dashboard & EDA

Welcome to the **Superstore Interactive Dashboard & EDA**! 🎉 This repository is your one-stop shop for exploring the Superstore dataset with a sleek, interactive dashboard and a deep-dive exploratory data analysis (EDA). Powered by Python, this project combines a futuristic Dash dashboard with comprehensive Jupyter Notebook analysis to uncover insights with style and flair! 🚀

## 🎯 What's Inside?

### 1. **Interactive Dashboard (`main.py`)**
A dynamic, dark-themed dashboard built with Dash to visualize Superstore sales data. Filter, explore, and interact with stunning charts!

- **🛠️ Interactive Filters**: Slice data by **region**, **category**, **year**, and **discount range** using dropdowns and a slick range slider.
- **📊 Visualizations**:
  - **Bar Chart**: Total sales by category in vibrant hues.
  - **Scatter Plot**: Sales vs. profit, colored by discount, sized by quantity.
  - **Line Chart**: Sales trends over time with a neon glow.
  - **Pie Chart**: Sales share by category in a colorful pie.
  - **Heatmap**: Correlations between sales, quantity, discount, and profit.
- **🌑 Dark Theme**: A modern, neon-accented interface for a premium feel.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fixed sidebar for filters, spacious chart area.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`main.ipynb`)**
A Jupyter Notebook packed with data cleaning, analysis, and creative visualizations to uncover hidden patterns in the Superstore dataset.

- **🧹 Data Cleaning**:
  - Converts `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime.
  - Removes outliers in `Profit` using IQR method.
  - Screens data for positive profit, specific categories (e.g., Technology, Furniture), and discount levels.
- **🔍 EDA**:
  - **Numeric Analysis**: Histograms for sales/profit, correlation heatmap.
  - **Categorical Analysis**: Bar plots for sales by category, box plots for profit by region.
  - **Time Series**: Line plot of yearly sales trends.
- **🎨 Creative Visuals**:
  - Pie chart for category sales share.
  - Pairplot for multivariate relationships.
  - Word cloud of product names.
- **😄 Fun Insights**:
  - Simple linear regression to predict profit from sales and discount.
  - Analysis of whether high discounts lead to profits (spoiler: they don’t! 😜).

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses `superstore.csv`, a rich dataset with columns like `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Region`, `Category`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, and `Quantity`. Both `main.py` and `main.ipynb` rely on this file.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages to unleash the magic:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud scikit-learn
```

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**: Place `superstore.csv` in the same directory as `main.py` and `main.ipynb`.

3. **Run the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` in your browser to explore the dashboard! 🎉

4. **Run the EDA**:
   Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
   Run the cells to dive into the analysis!

## 💻 Code Breakdown

- **main.py** (Dashboard):
  - Loads and processes data with pandas.
  - Builds a Dash app with a fixed sidebar (filters) and main content (charts).
  - Uses Plotly for interactive visualizations, updated via callbacks.
  - Features a dark theme with neon accents.

- **main.ipynb** (EDA):
  - **Data Prep**: Cleans data, removes outliers, and filters by categories/discounts.
  - **EDA**: Visualizes distributions, correlations, and trends with matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly.
  - **Creative Visuals**: Includes pie charts, pairplots, and a word cloud.
  - **Fun Analysis**: Tests profit prediction and investigates discount impacts.
